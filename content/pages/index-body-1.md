body1: "We're a group of people doing good different at the emerging edges.
  You'll find information about the community, what we're up to, and how you can
  join in. You'll also find a growing toolkit for doing exploratory,
  boundary-blurring work that engages with big, tangled, messy problems.\r

  \r


  These pages contain information about how you can join in with the
  community. For now, the best way to find out more is to join us [on
  Discord](https://discord.gg/vFWqz3PRzQ).\r


  \r

  You can also find the techie side of the project, like this website, on [our
  Github page](https://github.com/Divergent-Pathfinders).


  \r

  \r

  This community is just starting up. If you're interested but not quite ready
  to join, then please sign up to our mailing list for updates.


  Who is this for?\r


  Divergent Pathfinders is a space for people who have two qualities which -
  in the right circumstances - allow them to do wonderful things. Unfortunately,
  the right circumstances aren't very common. This space is intended to both
  provide such circumstance, and develop effective practice around providing it
  to others.\r

  \r


  Subtle Divergence\r


  Subtly divergent people experience the world in significantly different ways
  to those around them. They feel, think, and do unconventional things. This can
  include people who are neurodivergent, LGBTQ+, gender divergent, and/or from a
  different culture to those around them. The different perspective,
  sensibilities and capabilities that subtly divergent people possess allows
  them to see and work with things others do not.\r

  \r


  Compassionate Connection\r


  Compassionate connectors see the world in a linky, big-picture, intuitive
  way. They tend to work with people and/or other living beings and the
  relationships those beings rely upon. They have an intuitive instinct for
  complexity and are drawn to messy, tangled problems. The intuitive ability to
  see through the tangle and work with problems others find overwhelmingly
  complex is some of the most valuable work compassionate connectors can do for
  themselves and others.\r


  \r

  What's next?\r


  After experimenting with lots of online community platforms, it became
  obvious none could support the kind of co-created, collaborative, open work
  that this community is built on. So, we're building our own. Or, at least,
  assembling it from parts other people have built. We'll be documenting the
  process and releasing any code we write as part of the process."
